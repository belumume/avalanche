# ðŸ—» Avalanche

Avalanche is a hypothetical company that sells winter sports gear. 

This data set is comprised of:
- Customer reviews
- Product catalog
- Order history
- Shipping log

We'll use the **customer reviews** data to build a dashboard.

## Unstructured data

The unstructured version of the data is provided in the `files` directory. From there you can find additional sub-directory called `customer_reviews` that contains a collection of `DOCX` files.
